# MacroHotKeys
## Allows you to use in-game macros via keybinds

**Current State:**
- Default keys are KP0-9. This will change inthe future to allow for customer keybinds
- There is not a way to save keybonds at the moment
- This has only been tested to work with up to 10 macros at a time. If you need more than that, you are way too busy and need to tone it down!
- Nothing is saved per character
- Adding a new macro will not assign to a key until reloaded in addons menu

**Future State**
- Set any keybinds you like
- Saved on a per character basis
- Keybinds edited via in game Options
- Adding/removing macros automatically refreshes keybinds

This mod uses a very early (and WIP) version of [Pantheon Addons Library](https://github.com/ModsOfPantheon/PantheonAddons)
